# Python

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.

## Use Cases

Python is used for:

- Web development (server-side)
- Software development
- Mathematics
- System scripting

## Capabilities

Python can:

- Create web applications on servers
- Be used alongside software to create workflows
- Connect to database systems and read/modify files
- Handle big data and perform complex mathematics
- Be used for rapid prototyping or production-ready software development

## Advantages

- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- Simple syntax similar to the English language
- Concise code compared to some other programming languages
- Interpreter-based execution, allowing quick prototyping
- Supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming paradigms

## Version Information

- The most recent major version is Python 3, which is used in this tutorial
- Python 2, while only receiving security updates, remains popular

## Development Environments

Python can be written in:

- Text editors
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans, or Eclipse

## Syntax Comparison

Compared to other programming languages, Python:

- Emphasizes readability
- Uses new lines to complete commands instead of semicolons or parentheses
- Relies on indentation (whitespace) to define scope for loops, functions, and classes

# Important Notes

## 1. Indentation

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code. The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one. You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error.
